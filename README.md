# BackupIgnore
Backup files and folders but ignore directories containing a BACKUP.ignore file. 

I wrote this as a quick and dirty backup to an external drive and OneDrive from projects with code and large directories of binary files. 

Set your backup directories and add an empty file called "BACKUP.ignore" to any directory you don't want to keep. 

OneDrive syncing is also forced.
